# accordion-faq-card
This is my take on frontendmentor.io 's FAQ card challenge, which I wrote using HTML5, CSS3/FLEXBOX &amp; Vanilla JS. <br>
For me, the purpose of working on this challenge was to practice my layout skills as it was indeed something I struggled with while learning HTML & CSS. 

Things that I learned / practiced while working on this project: <br>
-Creating organized layouts using Flexbox <br>
-Changing an element's positioning using relative & absolute methods <br>
-Implementation of CSS media queries for a mobile-first responsive design <br>
-Basic DOM manipulation with Vanilla JS <br>
-Applying event listeners to HTML components <br>
-Basic animations with CSS/JS <br>
-Creation of collapsible content without relying on CSS frameworks like Bootstrap
